  <div id="parent">To be leaderless movements of resistors; to the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Electronic Age. We disrupt the aggregator feeds. We oppose the artificial migration of clouds. We resist the algorithm. We attack the natural world. And we do so as part of a growing opposition to the dangerous intrusion of neoliberalism.

This is not to say that we are the enemy. Nor that we stand alone, driven by an anarchic quest to burn down everything. It is only to say that we are part of a movement that is growing and also that we could be seen as its leaders and spokespeople.

What is the current form of that opposition? We design the future.<div id="border"></div></div>
